# 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah! 
Im a pharmacist born and residing in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil! I am very new in this Dev World, but I am willing to learn :) Nice to meet you!
### A little About Me
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Development (HTML/CSS/JS) and UX/UI design. I also like to play a little with graphic design sometimes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS, all mostly self-taught.
- 💞️ I’m not currently collaborating nor looking to collaborate with projects, but I'm always available to talk. Feel free to contact me anytime.


 
📫 You can reach me easier on my [e-mail](mailto:sarahnideck@yahoo.com.br). 

I also have a [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-nideck-86130a82/) account, but I have to warn you... That thing is very outdated 😆
